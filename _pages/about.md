Hey there! üëã

I'm Shreyansh, and I hold a Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs from <a href='https://cps.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-regulatory-affairs-toronto/'>Northeastern University - Toronto Campus</a> and a Master of Technology in Biomedical Engineering from <a href='https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering'>Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore</a>. I'm deeply invested in advancing the realms of Neuroscience and Rehabilitation Engineering through dedicated research. My passion lies in unraveling the intricacies of neuro-rehabilitation technology, aiming not just to comprehend but to actively enhance its capabilities.

**I'm actively pursuing both full-time positions and internships. I am flexible regarding relocation and open to roles beyond robotics. My priority lies in tackling significant challenges! Feel free to view my resume here. To connect, don't hesitate to reach out via email at <a href='mailto:shreyanshsheth5@gmail.com'>shreyanshsheth5@gmail.com</a> or through LinkedIn!** <script src="https://platform.linkedin.com/badges/js/profile.js" async defer type="text/javascript"></script>

In May 2021, I engaged in the <a href='https://www.gtec.at/spring-school-2021/'>BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2021</a> organized by g.tec Medical Engineering GmbH, immersing myself in cutting-edge advancements. My active involvement led to a feature on their <a href='https://www.gtec.at/quote/shreyansh-sheth/'>website</a>. Later, in October 2021, I contributed to the Siemens Healthineers Innovation Think Tank, collaborating on innovative solutions to prevalent healthcare challenges, blending technical prowess with non-technical methodologies.

Additionally, I'm constantly honing new skills‚ÄîI'm presently delving into Machine Learning and Project Management‚Äîor you might catch me engrossed in a game of Chess ‚ôüÔ∏è.
