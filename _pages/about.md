Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Shreyansh, and I am a Neuro-rehabilitation enthusiast. I graduated with Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs from <a href='https://cps.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-regulatory-affairs-toronto/'>Northeastern University - Toronto Campus</a> and with a Master of Technology in Biomedical Engineering from <a href='https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering'>Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore</a>.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
