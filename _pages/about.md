Hey there! üëã

I'm Shreyansh, and I hold a Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs from <a href='https://cps.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-regulatory-affairs-toronto/'>Northeastern University - Toronto Campus</a> and a Master of Technology in Biomedical Engineering from <a href='https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering'>Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore</a>. I'm deeply invested in advancing the realms of Neuroscience and Rehabilitation Engineering through dedicated research. My passion lies in unraveling the intricacies of neurorehabilitation technology, aiming not just to comprehend but to actively enhance its capabilities.

In May 2021, I engaged in the <a href='https://www.gtec.at/spring-school-2021/'>BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2021</a> organized by g.tec Medical Engineering GmbH, immersing myself in cutting-edge advancements. My active involvement led to a feature on their <a href='https://www.gtec.at/quote/shreyansh-sheth/'>website</a>. Later, in October 2021, I contributed to the Siemens Healthineers Innovation Think Tank, collaborating on innovative solutions to prevalent healthcare challenges, blending technical prowess with non-technical methodologies.

I'm actively seeking research opportunities within Biomedical Engineering, with a keen focus on Neurotechnology, Rehabilitation Engineering, and Embedded Systems. These specific areas captivate my interest and drive me to contribute meaningfully to their advancements. Additionally, I'm constantly honing new skills‚ÄîI'm presently delving into Machine Learning and Project Management‚Äîor you might catch me engrossed in a game of Chess ‚ôüÔ∏è.
