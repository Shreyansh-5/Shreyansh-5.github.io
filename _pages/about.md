Hey there! ðŸ‘‹<br>
I'm Shreyansh, and I hold a Master of Science in Regulatory Affairs from <a href='https://cps.northeastern.edu/program/master-of-science-in-regulatory-affairs-toronto/'>Northeastern University - Toronto Campus</a> and a Master of Technology in Biomedical Engineering from <a href='https://vit.ac.in/schools/school-of-electronics-engineering'>Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore</a>. I'm deeply invested in advancing the realms of Neuroscience and Rehabilitation Engineering through dedicated research. My passion lies in unraveling the intricacies of neuro-rehabilitation technology, aiming not just to comprehend but to actively enhance its capabilities. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> <b> I'm actively seeking full-time/part-time opportunities. I am flexible regarding relocation and open to roles beyond engineering. My priority lies in tackling significant challenges! Feel free to view my resume <a href='https://shreyansh-5.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf'>here</a>. To connect, don't hesitate to reach out via email at <a href='mailto:shreyanshsheth5@gmail.com'>shreyanshsheth5@gmail.com</a> or through LinkedIn! </b> </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> In May 2021, I engaged in the <a href='https://www.gtec.at/spring-school-2021/'>BCI & Neurotechnology Spring School 2021</a> organized by g.tec Medical Engineering GmbH, immersing myself in cutting-edge advancements. My active involvement led to a feature on their <a href='https://www.gtec.at/quote/shreyansh-sheth/'>website</a>. Later, in October 2021, I contributed to the Siemens Healthineers Innovation Think Tank, collaborating on innovative solutions to prevalent healthcare challenges, blending technical prowess with non-technical methodologies. </div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: justify"> Additionally, when I'm not busy with different things, you might spot me planning my next move on a chessboard, untangling the colors of a Rubik's Cube, diving into audiobooks to learn new stuff, or trying my hand at playing the piano. </div>
