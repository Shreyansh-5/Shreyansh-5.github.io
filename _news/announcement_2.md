**ðŸš€ Excited to share my recent achievement! ðŸŽ“ðŸ’¼**

***

I am thrilled to announce that I have graduated with a Master's degree in Regulatory Affairs from Northeastern University - Toronto campus, following the completion of my Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from Vellore Institute of Technology last year. I am eager to apply my knowledge and passion to contribute to a dynamic organization.

During my academic journey, I gained valuable experience through internships and various academic projects, which provided me with hands-on exposure to regulatory, engineering, and research aspects. I am excited to put these skills into practice and make a meaningful impact in a professional setting.

I am exploring various roles within the Medical Device, Pharmaceuticals, and Biotech industries, as I believe this will allow me to expand my knowledge and grow both personally and professionally. I am a quick learner, adaptable, and thrive in collaborative environments.

If you have any insights to share, I would greatly appreciate your support and guidance. Connecting with professionals in the industry would also be invaluable as I navigate this exciting phase.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all the mentors and professors who have supported me throughout this journey, including Dr. Peivand, Dr. Anthony Alsayed, and Dr. Ali Azizi. With the right opportunity, I am confident that I will be able to make a positive contribution and achieve success.

Please feel free to reach out to me. I am looking forward to connecting with professionals who are passionate about making a difference.
